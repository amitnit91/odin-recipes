            <li>Take poha in a large strainer. and Wash it 1-2 times by gently swifting them with your fingers under running water. Drain the excess water through a strainer. Sprinkle salt and sugar over it, mix/toss well and keep aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 2-tablespoons oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds; when they start to splutter, add cumin seeds, green chilies, curry leaves, peanuts and a pinch of asafoetida. Allow them to sizzle until chilies turn crisp for approx. 30-40 seconds.</li>
